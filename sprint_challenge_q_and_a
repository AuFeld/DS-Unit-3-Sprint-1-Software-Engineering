- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
  
In my opinion, the ability to share knowledge and to convey how someone went 
from "Point A" to "Point B" is the most important part of code reviews.   
Eg, you can be a great chef, but if you're writing a cook book and you can't 
effectively describe all of the steps to cook a great meal. Then the reader
will be unable to cook the great meal that the chef has created. 

- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation?

Just like docker's logo, a whale in the shape of a cargo ship loaded with containers
represents that an individual can store any type of application to be deployed in 
many different types of environments. Eg, for my past hackathon, the docker module 
would have been very useful when my team mate and I were trying to share what we built
with our other team mates who were in UX and Web Dev.
